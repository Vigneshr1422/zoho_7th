Sample Input 1 :

2 7 11 13
5 1
1 -1 -1 2 2
Sample Output 1:
2 7
-1 2
-1 2
Explanation for Sample 1:
For the first test case, we can see that the sum of  2 and 7 is equal to 9 
and it is the only valid pair.

For the second test case, there are two valid pairs 
(-1,2) and (-1,2), which add up to 1.
